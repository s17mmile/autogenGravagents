USER QUERY: "{user_query}"

Based on your knowledge of gravitational wave physics and data analysis, analyze this query and create a structured analysis plan. Consider:

1. What gravitational wave concepts are involved?
2. What data sources might be needed (LIGO, Virgo, public datasets)?
3. What analysis techniques are appropriate (filtering, parameter estimation, etc.)?
4. What visualization or output would be most informative?

Break down the request into 2-4 specific computational tasks that follow gravitational wave analysis best practices.

For example, if asked to "analyze GW150914":
1. Load GW150914 strain data from LIGO Open Science Center
2. Apply bandpass filtering (35-350 Hz) to remove noise  
3. Perform matched filtering with binary black hole templates
4. Create time-frequency spectrogram showing the chirp

Use your knowledge of standard gravitational wave analysis workflows to create appropriate tasks.
