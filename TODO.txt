Establish final directory structure:
	AgentConversationOutput
		--> one subfolder per conversation?
	MemoryBank
		Resources, PDFs
	
	System Messages
		Admin/User Interaction Agent
			--> Also gets Interpretation Prompt (from GUI/user input? Should be instantiated but possible to load later, if that is necessary.)
		Other Agents
	App code:
		Agent Config Editor
		GUI
		Conversation Code
		RAG Code, DB and management code
	main.py



Get an initial setup working to instantiate multiple agents as needed

--> Make sure that Human-in-The-Loop is always an option! (Implementation as "human" agent?)

Make sure each conversation generates a "capsuled-off" output directory with outputted code, results etc.

Implement and test RAG Agents
	--> AG2 deep research agent (requires browser-use, playwright)
	--> Ag2 DocAgent for local and online document retrieval and information extraction from documents

Separate CodingAgents and allow them to code within the output Directory that the conversation will be saved to.

RAG Agent should have persistent memory, however!
	--> Use shivam's chromadb or other autogen RAG setup (https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2023/10/18/RetrieveChat/)
	--> Split retirieving information through vectorized info database from web scraping for new info? Separate Agents! 

Build a simple GUI to edit the Agent config and start a conversation
	--> Separate Agent to generate system messages for other topic areas' agents?

Make Agent Conversation structure super easy to configure and edit
	--> Conversation config file should contain used agents and allowed conversation transitions
	--> This is, structure-wise, just a graph! Each node is an agent, each edge an allowed transition.
	--> Edge List structure for the configuration

Properly list dependencies and respective versions

Create visual agent workflow chart to make sure we have enough agents and each one can do its job(s).

(Possible addition: make the agent system more flexible by incorporating an agent to generate system messages for other agents?)
