DONE Get an initial setup working to instantiate multiple agents as needed

DONE Make sure that Human-in-The-Loop is always an option! (Implementation as "human" agent?)

NEXT Make sure each conversation generates a "capsuled-off" output directory with outputted code, results etc.

NEXT redo human-in-the-loop to ensure the conversation exits at a useful point --> maybe check reasoningAgent requiresClarification and then force human input?
--> Otherwise, do HITL as simply a difference in the conversation graph with no incoming 

THEN make simple GUI to enable easier testing

Implement and test RAG Agents
	--> AG2 deep research agent (requires browser-use, playwright)
	--> Ag2 DocAgent for local and online document retrieval and information extraction from documents

Separate CodingAgents and allow them to code within the output Directory that the conversation will be saved to.

RAG Agent should have persistent memory, however!
	--> Use shivam's chromadb or other autogen RAG setup (https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2023/10/18/RetrieveChat/)
	--> Split retirieving information through vectorized info database from web scraping for new info? Separate Agents! 

END: Properly list dependencies and respective versions

END: Make some nicer docs and a README

(Possible addition: make the agent system more flexible by incorporating an agent to generate system messages for other agents?)
--> QueryAgent already grades the config, so that should be the metric.
--> If not, it may be enough to give it the option to create a hard-coded instance of flexibleChat that is specifically made to generate code/system messages for agents.
