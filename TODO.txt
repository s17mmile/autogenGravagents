DONE Get an initial setup working to instantiate multiple agents as needed

DONE Make sure that Human-in-The-Loop is always an option! (Implementation as "human" agent?)

NEXT Make sure each conversation generates a "capsuled-off" output directory with outputted code, results etc.

redo human-in-the-loop to ensure the conversation exits at a useful point --> maybe check reasoningAgent requiresClarification and then force human input?
--> Otherwise, do HITL as simply a difference in the conversation graph with no incoming 
--> The human should be prompted to intervene not only if the AI needs more information but also when reasoning so far has resulted in a logical loop or no further progress is made.

Split queryAgent into a TaskBreakdownAgent and a configCheckerAgent.

make simple GUI to enable easier testing

Rethink agent output format to include a couple of always-needed fields:
	- message
	- nextAgentName

Allow passing of callables as tools outside of the flexibleChat class.

create conversation summarizing agent

Implement and test RAG Agents
	--> AG2 deep research agent (requires browser-use, playwright)
	--> Ag2 DocAgent for local and online document retrieval and information extraction from documents

Separate CodingAgents and allow them to code within the output Directory that the conversation will be saved to.

RAG Agent should have persistent memory, however!
	--> Use shivam's chromadb or other autogen RAG setup (https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2023/10/18/RetrieveChat/)
	--> Split retirieving information through vectorized info database from web scraping for new info? Separate Agents! 

Make nicer GUI. Feature ideas:
	--> Make messages appear as message bubbles, like an actual chat
	--> Visual graph editor, highlight current speaker node
	--> Import and continue old conversations

END: Properly list dependencies and respective versions

END: Make some nicer docs and a README

(Possible addition: make the agent system more flexible by incorporating an agent to generate system messages for other agents?)
--> QueryAgent already grades the config, so that should be the metric.
--> If not, it may be enough to give it the option to create a hard-coded instance of flexibleChat that is specifically made to generate code/system messages for agents.
