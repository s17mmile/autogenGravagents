Establish final directory structure:
	AgentConversationOutput
		--> one subfolder per conversation?
	MemoryBank
		Resources, PDFs
	Admin/User Interaction Agent
		System Message
		Interpretation Prompt
	Other Agents
		System Messages
	App code:
		Agent Config Editor
		GUI
		Conversation Code
		RAG Code, DB and management code
	main.py



Make sure each conversation generates a "capsuled-off" output directory with outputted code, results etc.

Implement and test RAG and Coder Agents
RAG Agent should have persistent memory, however!
	--> Use shivam's chromadb or other autogen RAG setup (https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2023/10/18/RetrieveChat/)

Build a simple GUI to edit the Agent config and start a conversation
	--> Separate Agent to generate system messages for other topic areas' agents?

Make Agent Conversation structure super easy to configure and edit
	--> Conversation config file should contain used agents and allowed conversation transitions
	--> This is, structure-wise, just a graph! Each node is an agent, each edge an allowed transition.
	--> Edge List structure for the configuration
	--> Create an Agent for each given System Message in the appropriate folder. This allows for easy scalability and expansion of the agent system.

Properly list dependencies and respective versions
