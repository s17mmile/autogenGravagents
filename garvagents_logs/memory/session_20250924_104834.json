    "knowledge_context": "GW170817 is the first observed binary neutron star merger, detected by LIGO's H1 and L1 detectors and Virgo (V1). The event is characterized by a long-duration, increasing-frequency chirp signal. Public strain data is available from GWOSC. Standard analysis involves filtering the data to remove noise and visualizing both the time-domain waveform and its frequency evolution using a spectrogram.",
    "scientific_context": "Filtering the data in the appropriate frequency band enhances the visibility of the binary neutron star signal, which is longer and covers a broader frequency range than binary black hole mergers. Time-domain plots and spectrograms are standard tools to visualize the evolution and frequency content of gravitational wave signals, especially for events like GW170817.",
