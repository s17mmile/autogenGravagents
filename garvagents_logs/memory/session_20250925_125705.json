It must be run in an environment with access to the LIGO Open Science Center (for data download).\n- **Runtime:** Template bank generation and matched filtering are computationally intensive and may take several minutes to hours depending on hardware.\n- **Memory:** The template bank is stored in memory; for large parameter spaces, memory usage can be significant.\n- **Output:** The script prints progress and results to the console. It also saves the best-fit template parameters and SNR time series as `.npy` files for further analysis.\n- **Error Handling:** The script will exit on critical errors (e.g., data download failure), but will continue past individual template generation/filtering errors.\n- **Parameter Uncertainties:** Uncertainties are estimated from the SNR drop in the local template grid; for more robust estimation, a denser grid or full Bayesian inference would be needed.\n- **Comparison:** The script compares the best-fit parameters to published GW170608 values and reports SNR significance.\n- **Customization:** You may adjust the mass/spin grid or frequency range for finer or coarser searches as needed.\n\n**Ready to execute as a single Python script.**",

It must be run in an environment with access to the LIGO Open Science Center (for data download).\n- **Runtime:** Template bank generation and matched filtering are computationally intensive and may take several minutes to hours depending on hardware.\n- **Memory:** The template bank is stored in memory; for large parameter spaces, memory usage can be significant.\n- **Output:** The script prints progress and results to the console. It also saves the best-fit template parameters and SNR time series as `.npy` files for further analysis.\n- **Error Handling:** The script will exit on critical errors (e.g., data download failure), but will continue past individual template generation/filtering errors.\n- **Parameter Uncertainties:** Uncertainties are estimated from the SNR drop in the local template grid; for more robust estimation, a denser grid or full Bayesian inference would be needed.\n- **Comparison:** The script compares the best-fit parameters to published GW170608 values and reports SNR significance.\n- **Customization:** You may adjust the mass/spin grid or frequency range for finer or coarser searches as needed.\n\n**Ready to execute as a single Python script.**",
