    "knowledge_context": "GW170608 is a binary black hole merger observed by LIGO. The strain data is available from the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC). Bandpass filtering between 35\u2013350 Hz is standard to isolate the frequency band where LIGO is most sensitive and where the GW signal is expected. Q-transform is a time-frequency analysis technique that reveals the chirp signature of compact binary coalescences. GWpy provides convenient methods for data access, filtering, and visualization.",
    "scientific_context": "This workflow follows standard gravitational wave data analysis practices: downloading public strain data, filtering to isolate the GW signal, visualizing the time-domain waveform to see the merger, and using Q-transform to reveal the characteristic chirp in the time-frequency domain. This approach highlights the short-duration, high-frequency burst from the binary black hole merger.",

We'll use the `TimeSeries.q_transform()` method from GWpy, focusing on a window around the event time (\u00b10.5 s) and a frequency range relevant to the signal (e.g., 20\u2013400 Hz). We'll include error handling, progress reporting, and clear axis labeling. The code will display the spectrograms for both detectors.\n\nCODE:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# GW170608 event time and Q-transform window\nevent_time = 1180922494.5\nq_window = 0.5  # seconds before and after event\nq_start = event_time - q_window\nq_end = event_time + q_window\n\n# Frequency range for Q-transform\nfmin = 20\nfmax = 400\n\ndef plot_qtransform(strain, det, event_time, q_start, q_end, fmin, fmax):\n    if strain is None:\n        print(f\"Warning: No filtered strain data for {det}, skipping Q-transform.\")\n        return\n    try:\n        print(f\"Computing Q-transform for {det} from {q_start} to {q_end} s...\")\n        # Crop to window of interest\n        cropped = strain.crop(q_start, q_end)\n        # Compute Q-transform\n        q = cropped.q_transform(outseg=(q_start, q_end), frange=(fmin, fmax))\n        print(f\"Plotting Q-transform spectrogram for {det}...\")\n        fig = q.plot()\n        ax = fig.gca()\n        ax.axvline(event_time, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Merger Time')\n        ax.set_title(f'{det} Q-transform Spectrogram around GW170608')\n        ax.set_xlabel('GPS Time [s]')\n        ax.set_ylabel('Frequency [Hz]')\n        ax.legend()\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        plt.show()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error generating Q-transform for {det}: {e}\")\n\n# Q-transform for H1\nplot_qtransform(filtered_strain_H1, 'H1', event_time, q_start, q_end, fmin, fmax)\n\n# Q-transform for L1\nplot_qtransform(filtered_strain_L1, 'L1', event_time, q_start, q_end, fmin, fmax)\n```\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code defines a function to compute and plot the Q-transform spectrogram for a given detector's filtered strain data, focusing on \u00b10.5 seconds around the merger and 20\u2013400 Hz. It uses GWpy's `q_transform()` method, adds a vertical line at the merger time, and labels the axes and title. The function is called for both H1 and L1. Progress and error messages are printed. The output will be two spectrogram plots, one for each detector, showing the burst signal in the time-frequency domain.",
