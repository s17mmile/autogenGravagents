      "raw_llm_response": "INTEGRATION ANALYSIS:\nThis workflow consists of two sequential tasks: (1) downloading the GW150914 strain data for both H1 and L1 detectors using PyCBC, and (2) plotting the raw strain data from both detectors on a single figure. The output of the first task (the strain data) is directly used by the second task. \n\nKey integration points:\n- All imports are consolidated at the top, with no duplicates.\n- The `print_progress` function is defined once and used throughout.\n- Variables (`strain_H1`, `strain_L1`) are passed cleanly between steps.\n- Comprehensive error handling is included: if data loading fails, the script reports the error and halts.\n- Progress messages are printed at each major step.\n- The script saves the raw strain data as `.npy` files for reproducibility.\n- The final plot is saved as a PNG file in addition to being displayed.\n- The script is ready to run as a standalone Python file.\n\nINTEGRATED SCRIPT:\n```python\n# --- Imports ---\nimport sys\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pycbc.catalog import Merger\n\n# --- Utility Functions ---\ndef print_progress(msg):\n    print(f\"[INFO] {msg}\")\n\ndef save_numpy_array(filename, array):\n    try:\n        np.save(filename, array)\n        print_progress(f\"Saved array to {filename}.npy\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[WARNING] Could not save {filename}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# --- Task 1: Download the strain data for GW150914 ---\nprint_progress(\"Fetching GW150914 event information from PyCBC catalog...\")\nstrain_H1 = None\nstrain_L1 = None\ngps_time = None\n\ntry:\n    gw_event = Merger(\"GW150914\")\n    gps_time = gw_event.time\n    print_progress(f\"GW150914 GPS time: {gps_time}\")\n\n    # Define a 32-second window centered on the event\n    duration = 32  # seconds\n    start = int(gps_time) - duration // 2\n    end = start + duration\n\n    print_progress(\"Downloading H1 strain data...\")\n    strain_H1 = gw_event.strain('H1', start, end)\n    print_progress(\"H1 strain data downloaded successfully.\")\n\n    print_progress(\"Downloading L1 strain data...\")\n    strain_L1 = gw_event.strain('L1', start, end)\n    print_progress(\"L1 strain data downloaded successfully.\")\n\n    # Save raw data for reproducibility\n    save_numpy_array(\"strain_H1_raw\", strain_H1.numpy())\n    save_numpy_array(\"strain_L1_raw\", strain_L1.numpy())\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"[ERROR] Failed to download or load strain data: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# --- Task 2: Plot the strain data for GW150914 ---\ntry:\n    if strain_H1 is None or strain_L1 is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Strain data for H1 or L1 not found.
