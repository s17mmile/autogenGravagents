Here are the steps we will take:\n\n1. **Calculate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need to write a Python script that calculates the first n Fibonacci numbers for n up to 10.\n2. **Plot the Results**: Once we have the Fibonacci numbers, we will plot these numbers against n using a plotting library.\n3. **Save the Plot**: The plot will be saved as 'fibonacci_plot.png'.\n4. **Calculate the 150th Fibonacci Number**: We will also calculate the 150th Fibonacci number separately.\n\nI will assign these tasks to the appropriate agents now.",
