    "message": "To create a Python script that calculates the first n Fibonacci numbers, we can follow the outlined sub-tasks. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Define the Fibonacci Sequence and Its Properties**:\n   - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1. Thus, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\n   - Mathematically, it can be defined as:\n     - F(0) = 0\n     - F(1) = 1\n     - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1\n\n2. **Implement a Function in Python that Calculates Fibonacci Numbers up to n**:\n   - We can implement this using either an iterative or recursive approach. The iterative approach is generally more efficient for larger values of n.\n\n3. **Create a User Input Mechanism**:\n   - We will use the `input()` function to allow the user to specify the value of n. We should also include error handling to ensure that the input is a valid positive integer.\n\n4. **Test the Script**:\n   - After implementing the script, we should run several test cases to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\n### Here\u2019s a sample Python script that accomplishes these tasks:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    fib_sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        fib_sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return fib_sequence\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        n = int(input('Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate: '))\n        if n < 0:\n            print('Please enter a non-negative integer.')\n        else:\n            print(f'The first {n} Fibonacci numbers are: {fibonacci(n)}')\n    except ValueError:\n        print('Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.')\n```\n\n### Suggested Next Steps:\n- Review the script for any additional features or improvements, such as allowing the user to choose between iterative and recursive methods.\n- Consider implementing a way to visualize the Fibonacci sequence, such as plotting the numbers using a library like Matplotlib.\n- Test the script with various inputs to ensure robustness and correctness."
